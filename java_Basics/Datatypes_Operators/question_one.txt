1) Explain the difference between primitive and reference data types with examples.
ans.  

Feature	                       Primitive Data Type	                              Reference Data Type
Definition	           Stores actual values directly in memory.	            Stores a reference (memory address) pointing to an object.
Memory Storage	          Stored in stack memory.	                        Stored in heap memory, while reference is in the stack.
Mutability	           Immutable (values cannot be changed).	            Mutable (objects can be modified).
Comparison	                 Compared by value.	                              Compared by reference (memory location).
Example               Data Types Numbers, characters,                        Arrays, objects, functions, strings (in some languages like Java).
                   booleans (int, char, float, boolean).	


Example:   
 
primitive data type:

int a = 10;
int b = a;
b = 20 ; 

System.out.println(a); // Output: 10
System.out.println(b); // Output: 20


2.Reference datatype example;

int[] arr1 = {1, 2, 3};
int[] arr2 = arr1; // Copying reference and having address of arr1[0], NOT values 
arr2[0] = 99;
System.out.println(arr1[0]); // Output: 99
